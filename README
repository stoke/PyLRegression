PyLRegression, A logistic regression classifier applied to an "OR" function written in python (it uses numpy), just for educational purposes.

Usage:

Do you really want to use it? LOL.

First of all, run:

python lr_training.py -f <filename_where_to_save_thetas> -i <iterations=400> -a <alpha=0.1>

Where "iteration" parameter is the max number of iterations for gradient descent (default 400) and "alpha" is the learning rate.

Then, supposing that thetas are stored in "ts.txt", and we want to "calculate" 1 AND 1, run:

python lr.py -f ts.txt 1:1

Enjoy, stoke.
